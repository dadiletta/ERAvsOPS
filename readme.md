# MLB ERA vs OPS Visualization

An interactive web application that visualizes Major League Baseball team performance by plotting Earned Run Average (ERA) against On-base Plus Slugging (OPS) in a dynamic scatter plot with division filtering.

## 📊 Overview

This tool helps baseball analysts and fans visualize team performance by placing teams in quadrants based on their ERA (pitching effectiveness) and OPS (offensive production):

- **Good Pitching, Good Hitting**: Teams excelling in both areas (low ERA, high OPS)
- **Good Pitching, Bad Hitting**: Teams with strong pitching but weaker offense
- **Bad Pitching, Good Hitting**: Teams with strong offense but weaker pitching
- **Bad Pitching, Bad Hitting**: Teams struggling in both areas

## 🚀 Features

- **Interactive Scatter Plot**: Teams displayed with official team logos
- **Division Filtering**: Toggle visibility of specific MLB divisions (AL East, NL West, etc.)
- **Quadrant Analysis**: Color-coded backgrounds for different performance zones
- **Hover Details**: View team name, ERA, OPS, and division information
- **Automatic Data Updates**: Configurable cache timeouts
- **Team History**: View historical performance trends when hovering over teams
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

## 📈 Understanding the Metrics

### ERA (Earned Run Average)

ERA measures a pitcher's effectiveness by calculating how many earned runs they allow per nine innings pitched. Only runs scored without the benefit of defensive errors count as "earned." Lower ERA values indicate better pitching performance.

- **Excellent**: ≤ 3.00
- **Good**: 3.00-4.00
- **Average**: 4.00-5.00
- **Poor**: 5.00+

### OPS (On-base Plus Slugging)

OPS combines on-base percentage (how often a batter reaches base) and slugging percentage (total bases divided by at-bats) to provide a comprehensive view of offensive performance. Higher OPS values indicate better hitting.

- **Excellent**: .900+
- **Good**: .800-.899
- **Average**: .700-.799
- **Poor**: ≤.699

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

- **Backend**: Python Flask web application
- **Database**: SQLite (development) / PostgreSQL (production)
- **Frontend**: JavaScript with Chart.js for visualization
- **Data Source**: MLB Stats API via MLB-StatsAPI package
- **Caching**: Database snapshots with configurable timeouts
- **Deployment**: Docker support, Render configuration included

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/eravsops.git
   cd eravsops
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file with your configuration:
   ```
   FLASK_ENV=development
   SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
   CACHE_TIMEOUT=3600
   ```

5. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

6. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000

## 🐳 Docker Deployment

You can also run the application using Docker:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

This will start both the web application and a PostgreSQL database container.

## 📱 Customization

- **Division Filtering**: Toggle divisions by clicking on the division buttons at the top of the chart
- **Logo Size**: Adjust the `--logo-width` variable in CSS
- **Quadrant Colors**: Modify the `quadrantColors` object in `chart.js`
- **Chart Dimensions**: Change scales in the Chart.js configuration
- **Boundary Lines**: Adjust the `axisLines` values in `chart.js`

## 📊 Division Filtering

The application includes a division filtering feature that allows you to:

- Toggle visibility of specific MLB divisions (AL East, AL Central, AL West, NL East, NL Central, NL West)
- Visually compare teams within the same division
- Focus analysis on specific leagues or regions
- See division-specific trends in pitching and hitting performance
